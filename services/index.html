			<h3>Web Design</h3>
			<p>Simple, beautiful, well-formed, efficient websites don't happen by chance; they are planned down to the last detail. I use a simple four-step process in the execution of all of my clients websites, so the results are visible to your target audience within a short timeframe.</p>
			<h2><em>Plan</em></h2>
			<p>Good websites don't come by chance. A good plan is essential to end up with a good result. Come up with some decent ideas, and implement it to form an online presence that will be effective towards your target audience. We talk to you and discuss everything, including researching your competitors and clients, using every little helpful detail to draw up a plan for an effective, long-lasting online presence.</p>
			<h2><em>Prototype</em></h2>
			<p>I then bring the plan to life. I sketch up the site on paper, moving elements around until everything fits into what the original plan represented - then we optimise it, and I start the coding process.</p>
			<h2><em>Tweak</em></h2>
			<p>Once the prototype is ready, I start tweaking it to your liking. Want to move something to the right? Done. Can we change that text colour? Done. Can you buy me a horse? No. I tweak it until it correlates to the original plan's specifications, plus the client's ideas brought up after the fact.</p>
			<h2><em>Publish</em></h2>
			<p>It's primetime. This is where I put all the hard work together to form the final result. I perform some final tweaks (if needed), test it cross-platform in different environments for broad support, tune the performance, then release it upon the world.</p>
			
			<p>After all the work is done, I can also offer to you my search engine optimisation (SEO) and social network marketing services for a discounted price, to get the word out to the people. If you want a quote, <a href="http://graphicgraffiti.com.au/contact/">click here</a>.</p>
